# FuzzyTime

by Michel Clasquin-Johnson

Written for Haiku in yab, using the Yabadabbadoo IDE

This desktop applet displays the time and date not in the precise format you would expect from a computer, but in a deliberately 'fuzzy', human-friendly way

USAGE: 

To MOVE FuzzyTime, left-click the 5-pixel yellow border. It mysteriously grows a standard yellow tab so you can move it anywhere on your screen. Left-click again to make the tab go away after you have moved the applet.

To EXIT FuzzyTime, right-click that same border. FuzzyTime will remember its previous position every time you start it.

FuzzyTime bundles Chris Tsai's CLI utility fuzzy_time.py, obtained from SourceForge and slightly adapted

If you want FuzzyTime to appear on every boot, put a link to it in /boot/home/config/settings/boot/launch
